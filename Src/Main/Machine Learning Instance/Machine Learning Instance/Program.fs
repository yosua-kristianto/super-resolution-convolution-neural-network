I think the problem is not with the open type statement, but with the way you are calling the Conv2D layer. In TensorFlow.NET, you need to use the functional API of the library, which allows you to create layers as callable objects and pass tensors to them. For example, if you want to create a Conv2D layer with 64 filters of size 9x9 and He normal initialization, and apply it to the input tensor, you can write:

```fsharp
open Tensorflow
open Tensorflow.Keras

// create a Conv2D layer with 64 filters of size 9x9 and He normal initialization
let conv2d = Layers.Conv2D(64, (9, 9), kernel_initializer="he_normal")

// apply the Conv2D layer to the input tensor
let output = conv2d input
```

This will produce an output tensor with shape (batch_size, new_height, new_width, 64), where new_height and new_width depend on the padding and strides arguments of the Conv2D layer. By default, the padding is "valid", which means no padding is applied, and the strides are (1, 1), which means the convolution window moves by one pixel along each dimension¹.

So, in your code, you should change this line:

```fsharp
let mutable x = tf.keras.layers.Conv2D(64, kernel_size=new Shape([| 9; 9 |]), kernel_initializer="he_normal");
```

to this:

```fsharp
let conv2d = Layers.Conv2D(64, (9, 9), kernel_initializer="he_normal");
```

And then call it like this:

```fsharp
let data = conv2d input;
```

This should fix the error and allow you to create a Conv2D layer in TensorFlow.NET. For more information about the Conv2D layer and other layers in TensorFlow.NET, you can check out the results from my search¹.
